# Facial Recognition using Computer Vision & Machine Learning

#### Group project to implement and compare different facial recognition methodologies such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Local Binary Pattern (LBP).

## Setup
1. We used google colab which is basically a jupyter notebook but in the cloud with access to your drive. Most things should work normally but file paths may differ. 
2. Upload images to google drive in ATT Dataset folder
3. You may have to update the file path
4. Open notebook in colab and connect to drive
5. Give permission to drive
6. Run code as you would normally for a jupyter notebook 

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. Image Preprocessing
    - Resize
    - Gaussian Filter
    -  Histogram Equalization
    -  Normalization
3. Facial Feature Extraction
    - Local Binary Pattern Algorithm
5. Classificiation of Features
   - SVM
   -  MLP
6. Analysis of Results
